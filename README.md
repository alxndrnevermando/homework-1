## homework-1

A little description of this homework assignment. The goal was to refactor an existing html and css code for the purpose of increasing it's accessibility. Additionally there was some work done to clean up the code.

## Motivation

I appreciated the homework assignment because it helped me to brush up on my html and css knowledge. I had sort of forgotten a majority of the concepts and practical applications because it had been almost two years since I last took a class on this. I really want to succeed in this course and push forward, as I know there are many opportunties out there in this field. 

## Features

Nothing too special yet, since this project was working on already written code. Looking forward to the next challenge.

## Installation
Pretty simple to deploy this, simply cut and paste the url into you preferred browser. No need to download.
